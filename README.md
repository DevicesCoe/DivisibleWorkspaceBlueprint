## Two Way Divisible Workspaces

The Divisible Workspaces design blueprint provides a drastically simplified installation for two-way combinable rooms while leveraging Cisco Pro Series Microphones (Ceiling and Table). 

Note, this concept is **not** a Cisco native feature but a **validated blueprint** that leverages the flexibility and customization capabilities within Room OS on Cisco Video Devices to achieve a predictable outcome. 

The solution leverages the following: 
- Cisco Codec EQs or Codec Pros
- Cisco Table or Ceiling Microphone Pros (up to 8)
- Cisco Catalyst 9K Series Switches  
- Custom Macros including [Audio Zone Manager Library](https://github.com/ctg-tme/audio-zone-manager-library-macro?tab=readme-ov-file)
- Certified HDMI Distrubution Amplifiers: [Certified Third Party Devices](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/7sw4gab/Cisco-collaboration-devices-certification-program)

## Key Terminology: [Top](#table-of-contents)
| **Term** | **Definition** |
|---|---|
| Primary/Primary Codec | References the codec/room that provides the main control for all Divisible state changes, actions and where the macros are installed. |
| Secondary/Secondary Codec | References the codec/room that will **not** have an active role in a combined state. |
| Audience Camera | Refers to the Quad Camera at the front of each room. |
| Presenter Camera | Refers to the Speaker Tracking enabled PTZ camera in each room. |
| DWS_AZM_Lib.js | The Audio Zone Manager Library macro. This library contains the logic needed for clean audio based events. |
| DWS_Wizard.js | The initial setup wizard functionality loaded onto the Primary Codec. |
| DWS_Setup.js | A background macro that handles the installation and base configuration. |
| DWS_Core.js | The "main" macro that handles all logic. Runs on Primary Codec. |
| DWS_Node.js | The "secondary" macro that handles tasks on the Secondary Codec. |
| DWS_State.js | This autogenerated macro handles saving state for reboots, etc. |
| ciscortr.cfg | This is the pre-configured Cisco Catalyst 9K configuration file. |

## FAQ: [Top](#table-of-contents)
**Is this a Cisco TAC supported deployment?**
- No. This repository is a custom blueprint and is not supported through Cisco Technical Assistance Center. Implementation, troubleshooting and support would be the responsibility of the end customer or AV Integrator.

**How many Microphone Pros (Ceiling and Table) can I use in each room?**
- Combined mode operation can support a maximum of 8 microphones. They can be split amongst either room during split operation in any variation.

**Can I use Third Party Microphones with this blueprint?**
- No, this blueprint provides support for only Cisco Pro Series Microphones.

**Can this be used for 3-way(+) divisible spaces?**
- No, this blueprint is specifically designed to support 2-way divisible spaces.

**Does this blueprint support Voice Lift / Room re-enforcement scenarions?**
- No, this blueprint does not provide for voice lift scenarios.

**Where is the Partition Sensor?**
- This blueprint does not leverage a partition sensor. The Combine/Split operation is driven manually by the end user.

**Can you help me make this do "X"?**
- Any additional capabilities would require you or your AV Integrator to make **and** support any required modifications to the provided Macros directly.
